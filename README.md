## Tasks

### Task 1: Telemetry Data Analysis
Analyzed one month's telemetry data from four production facilities across Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, and Shenzhen. The goal was to identify:
1. Which location experienced the highest machine breakdowns?  
2. Which machines in that location broke down most frequently?

#### Steps:
- Imported telemetry data (JSON format) into Tableau.
- Created a calculated field called `Unhealthy Downtime`:
  - Assigned 10 minutes of downtime for each 'Unhealthy' status.
  - Measured potential downtime due to machine issues.
- Designed visualizations:
  - **Downtime by Factory**: Bar chart showing total unhealthy downtime per location.
  - **Downtime by Machine Type**: Bar chart highlighting the most problematic machines.
- Created an interactive dashboard to analyze factory-specific machine breakdown patterns.

#### Outcome:
Provided actionable insights into machine performance issues, allowing prioritization of maintenance to improve operational efficiency.

### Task 2: Gender Pay Gap Analysis
Investigated and addressed gender pay inequality across multiple locations and roles.

#### Steps:
- Processed compensation data provided in Excel format, which included:
  - Factory location, job role, and equality score (ranging from -100 to +100).
- Created a calculated column called `Equality Class`:
  - Classified roles based on equality scores into:
    - **Fair (±10)**  
    - **Unfair (< -10 or > 10)**  
    - **Highly Discriminative (< -20 or > 20)**  
- Analyzed the data to identify problem areas.

#### Outcome:
Highlighted roles and locations with significant pay discrepancies, providing a foundation for implementing equitable compensation policies.
